# Tinder Bot Automation ü§ñ‚ù§Ô∏è

This project automates the process of logging into Tinder using Google credentials and simulates liking profiles. It uses Selenium WebDriver for browser automation.

## Prerequisites

- Python 3.x
- Google Chrome browser
- ChromeDriver (compatible with your Chrome version)
- Selenium package

## Setup

1. **Clone the repository:**

    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/yourusername/tinder-bot-automation.git
    cd tinder-bot-automation
    ```

2. **Create a virtual environment:**

    ```bash
    python -m venv .venv
    ```

3. **Activate the virtual environment:**

    - On Windows:
        ```bash
        .venv\Scripts\activate
        ```
    - On macOS and Linux:
        ```bash
        source .venv/bin/activate
        ```

4. **Install dependencies:**

    ```bash
    pip install selenium
    ```

5. **Download ChromeDriver:**

    - Ensure you have the ChromeDriver that matches your version of Google Chrome.
    - Download from: [ChromeDriver](https://sites.google.com/chromium.org/driver/)
    - Place the `chromedriver` executable in a directory included in your system's PATH, or specify the path directly in the script:
      ```python
      search_engine = webdriver.Chrome(executable_path='/path/to/chromedriver', options=chrome_options)
      ```

## Configuration

Replace the placeholders for email and password in the script with your Google credentials:

```python
WebDriverWait(search_engine, 10).until(
    EC.visibility_of_element_located((By.ID, "identifierId"))
).send_keys("your_email@example.com", Keys.ENTER)

WebDriverWait(search_engine, 10).until(
    EC.visibility_of_element_located((By.NAME, 'Passwd'))
).send_keys("your_password", Keys.ENTER
```
Notes
Ensure your internet connection is stable.
Adjust the wait times (WebDriverWait) if necessary, depending on your network speed and system performance.

If you encounter issues with locating elements or interactions, the structure of the Tinder website may have changed. You may need to update the XPaths or CSS selectors in the script.

### Key Points to Note:

1. **Code Blocks**: Ensure that code blocks are enclosed in triple backticks (```), and regular text or Markdown sections should be outside these backticks.

2. **Text and Code Separation**: Make sure that any explanatory text is not inside code blocks. This ensures that Markdown renders it as regular text.

If you're using a Markdown editor or viewer, it should render the README properly if the syntax is correct. If you‚Äôre still having issues, check the Markdown viewer or editor settings for rendering issues.
